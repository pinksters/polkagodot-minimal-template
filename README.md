# PolkaGodot Minimal Template

This is a minimal starter project for the [PolkaGodot](https://github.com/pinksters/polkagodot-plugin) add-on.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository (or download as .zip).
   
    Important: when cloning, use `git clone --recursive` so the PolkaGodot submodule is downloaded as well.
    
2. Import the project in Godot Engine by navigating to `project.godot` at the root of this repo

3. Either create a new PolkaConfig resource at the root of the project, or find an example config for your desired chain in `res://addons/polkagodot/config_examples` and drag it to the root of the project (`res://`)

4. Adjust the config file with your deployed contract addresses, game ID, and chain info.
